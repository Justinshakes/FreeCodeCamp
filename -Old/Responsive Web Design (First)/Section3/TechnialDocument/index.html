                Java is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language.
                It is a robust and versatile language. Inside a host environment,
                Java can be connected to objects and libraries to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Java contains a standard library of classes, such as ArrayList,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                operators, control structures, and statements. Core Java can
                be extended for a variety of purposes by using additional classes and libraries.

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

                <li>
                    A general understanding of programming concepts.

                <li>Good working knowledge of software development principles.</li>
                <li>
                    Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, consider
                    taking an introductory Java course.

            <p>
                Java and JavaScript are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                different in others. The Java language is statically typed and has strong type checking,
                while JavaScript is dynamically typed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although JavaScript shares some syntax and naming conventions with Java, it has distinct
                features such as a prototype-based object model and functions without explicit types.
            </p>
            <p>
                Java enforces strict rules regarding variable declarations, access modifiers, and interfaces,
                while JavaScript offers more flexibility.

        <header>Hello world</header>
        <article>
            To get started with writing Java, create a class and write your first "Hello world" Java code:
            <code
            >public class HelloWorld {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                }
                }</code>

            Compile and run the code to see "Hello, World!" displayed in your console!

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
            In Java, you use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            Variable names, known as identifiers, must adhere to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Java identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($), followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
            Java is case-sensitive, so "A" and "a" are different identifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use Unicode characters in identifiers, making Java suitable for internationalization.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
            You can declare a variable in Java using the following syntax:
            <p>
                With the keyword "int" (for integers): <code>int x = 42;</code> This
                syntax can be used to declare both local and instance variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                By simply assigning it a value: <code>x = 42;</code> This always declares a variable and assigns
                a global variable in the context of a class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using other data types and keywords as needed. For example, you can declare a double variable like this:
                <code>double y = 13.0;</code> This syntax can be used to declare block scope local variables.
            </p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                In Java, when you declare a variable outside of any method, it is called an instance variable,
                available to any other code in the current class. When you declare a variable within a method,
                it is called a local variable, available only within that method.
            </p>

            <p>
                Java enforces block statement scope, which means a variable declared within a block is local to that
                block.
                For example, the following code will work as expected:
            </p>
            <code>if (true) { int x = 5; } System.out.println(x); // This will result in a compilation error</code>
            <p>
                This behavior ensures that variables are more closely scoped and helps prevent unintentional variable
                reuse.
            </p>

            <code
            >if (true) { int y = 5; } System.out.println(y); // This will result in a compilation error</code
            >
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                In Java, global variables are typically declared as static fields within a class.
                They are accessible to all instances of the class and are associated with the class itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consequently, you can access global variables from other classes by using the class name followed by the
                field name.
                For example, if a static variable called "phoneNumber" is declared in a class named "Utility," you can
                refer to it as "Utility.phoneNumber."
            </p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                In Java, you can create a read-only, named constant using the "final" keyword.
                The syntax for defining a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier.
            </p>

            <code>final double PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>
                A constant cannot change its value after initialization and cannot be re-declared while the program is
                running.
            </p>

            <p>
                Constants in Java follow the same scope rules as block scope variables.
                If you omit the "final" keyword, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable rather than a
                constant.
            </p>

            <p>
                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.
            </p>

            <code
            >// This will result in an error:
                // public void f() {};
                // final int f = 5;</code
            >
            However, object attributes are not protected, so you can modify them:
            <code
            >final MyObject MY_OBJECT = new MyObject();
                MY_OBJECT.setValue("otherValue");</code
            >

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
            <p>Java defines several data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Primitive data types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>boolean: true or false</li>
                        <li>byte: 8-bit integer</li>
                        <li>short: 16-bit integer</li>
                        <li>int: 32-bit integer</li>
                        <li>long: 64-bit integer</li>
                        <li>float: 32-bit floating-point</li>
                        <li>double: 64-bit floating-point</li>
                        <li>char: 16-bit Unicode character</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Reference types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Objects: Instances of classes that can store data and have methods to operate on that data.</li>
                        <li>Arrays: Ordered collections of elements of the same data type, accessed by an index.</li>
                        <li>Interfaces: Contracts that define a set of methods that a class must implement.</li>
                        <li>Enums: Special data types that consist of a fixed set of constants.</li>
                        <li>Custom reference types: Classes created by developers to define custom data structures and behaviors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            These data types enable you to perform various operations and store different types of data in your Java applications. Objects and classes are fundamental elements in the language, allowing you to define complex data structures and create reusable code.

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
            Use the "if" statement in Java to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
            You can also use the optional "else" clause to execute a different block of code if the condition is false.
            The basic syntax of an "if" statement is as follows:

            <code>if (condition) {
                // statement_1;
                } else {
                // statement_2;
                }</code>

            The "condition" can be any expression that evaluates to a boolean value (true or false).
            If the condition evaluates to true, "statement_1" is executed; otherwise, "statement_2" is executed.
            Both "statement_1" and "statement_2" can be single statements or compound statements enclosed in curly
            braces.
            <p>
                You can also use "else if" clauses to test multiple conditions in sequence:
            </p>
            <code
            >if (condition_1) {
                // statement_1;
                } else if (condition_2) {
                // statement_2;
                } else if (condition_n) {
                // statement_n;
                } else {
                // statement_last;
                }</code
            >
            In this case, only the first condition that evaluates to true will execute its corresponding block of code.
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
            A "while" statement in Java executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
            The basic syntax of a "while" statement is as follows:

            <code>while (condition) {
                // statement;
                }</code>
            If the "condition" evaluates to true, the "statement" within the loop is executed.
            After each execution of the "statement," the condition is re-evaluated.
            If the condition is still true, the loop continues; otherwise, the loop terminates, and control passes to
            the statement following the "while" block.

            <p>
                You can use block statements enclosed in curly braces to group multiple statements within the loop.
            </p>

            Example:

            <p>
                The following "while" loop iterates as long as "n" is less than three:
            </p>

            <code>int n = 0; int x = 0;
                while (n < 3) {
                n++;
                x += n;
                }</code>
            <p>
                After each iteration, the loop increments "n" and adds that value to "x."
                Therefore, "x" and "n" take on the following values:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: "n" = 1 and "x" = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: "n" = 2 and "x" = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: "n" = 3 and "x" = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition "n < 3" is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
            </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
            In Java, a function definition (also known as a method declaration) consists of the following parts:

            <ul>
                <li>The return type of the function, indicating what type of value the function will return.</li>
                <li>
                    The name of the function, used to identify and call the function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A list of parameters (arguments) enclosed in parentheses, specifying the data types and names of the
                    arguments the function expects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Java statements that define the function's behavior, enclosed in curly braces, { }.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, the following code defines a simple function (method) named "square" in a class:
            </p>

            <code>public int square(int number) {
                return number * number;
                }</code>
            <p>
                In this example:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The return type is "int," indicating that the function will return an integer value.</li>
                <li>
                    The name of the function is "square."
                </li>
                <li>
                    The function takes one parameter named "number" of type "int."
                </li>
                <li>
                    The function consists of one statement that calculates the square of the input number and returns it
                    as an integer.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In Java, primitive parameters (such as "int") are passed to functions by value, meaning that a copy of
                the value is passed to the function.
                If the function modifies the parameter's value, it does not affect the original value outside of the
                function.
