        <p class="tip">Adjust your rate you fire depending on the range you're fighting at. Use fully automatic fire
            when fighting
            up close and at medium range, and fire in three-round bursts at long range, exploiting the Heavy Pulse
            Rifle's perfect accuracy for its first 3 shots in a burst. (Spread has been replaced with vertical recoil,
            so the accuracy remains pin-point no matter how many shots you take.)</p>

        <p class="tip">- Helix Rockets can be used to deal burst damage, killing an enemy before they can escape or use
            an ability.
            <br><br>- If you're unsure of your aim, or are against an evasive opponent, fire Helix Rockets at your
            enemy's feet instead of directly at them. This will ensure that the explosion damages them, even if you
            can't directly hit them with the rockets.
            <br><br>- Helix Rockets self damage can kill you if your health is too low.</p>
