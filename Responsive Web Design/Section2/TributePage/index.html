        <ul id="timeline">
            <li><strong>January 2023</strong> – Born into a cozy litter of six puppies.</li>
            <li><strong>March 2023</strong> – Found his forever home on the farm.</li>
            <li><strong>June 2023</strong> – Underwent a minor surgery to remove a baby tooth. Recovered like a champ.</li>
            <li><strong>August 2023</strong> – Fell in love with tug-of-war — and became undefeated in backyard matches.</li>
            <li><strong>October 2023</strong> – Took his first swim in the lake and turned out to be a natural-born swimmer.</li>
            <li><strong>December 2023</strong> – Experienced snow for the first time. Rolled, jumped, and ate snowflakes.</li>
            <li><strong>February 2024</strong> – Celebrated his first birthday with a special cake and all his favorite humans.</li>
            <li><strong>April 2024</strong> – Learned a new trick: opening doors with his paw (clever little guy!).</li>
            <li><strong>July 2024</strong> – Took his first beach trip and chased seagulls like it was his full-time job.</li>
