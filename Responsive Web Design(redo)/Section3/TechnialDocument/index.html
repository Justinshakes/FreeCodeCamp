        <p>Soldier: 76 is a versatile damage hero with a focus on mobility, sustained fire, and self-healing. His
            abilities allow him to deal damage at medium range while maintaining good positioning with his sprint and
            healing capabilities.</p>

        <header>Passive</header>
        <p>As a damage hero, Soldier: 76 benefits from the passive ability that all damage characters share: increased
            movement speed after eliminations. This helps him chase down enemies and reposition quickly.</p>

        <header>Helix Rockets</header>
        <p>Helix Rockets are a secondary fire option for Soldier: 76, launching a small burst of rockets that explode on
            impact. These rockets deal significant burst damage and are great for finishing off enemies or applying
            pressure in close combat.</p>

            quickly get into position, escape danger, or chase down fleeing enemies. This ability has no cooldown,
            allowing him to use it freely.</p>

        <header>Biotic Field</header>
        <p>Soldier: 76 deploys a Biotic Field, which creates an area that heals him and any allies within its range.
            This ability provides crucial sustainability, making Soldier: 76 a durable threat in prolonged fights.</p>

    <section id="Tactical_Visor" class="main-section">
        <header>Tactical Visor</header>
        <p>Tactical Visor is Soldier: 76's ultimate ability. When activated, it automatically locks on to enemies in his
            line of sight, allowing him to fire his weapon without missing. This is particularly powerful in team fights
            where precision and quick eliminations are key.</p>
        <code></code>
        <ul>
            <li>Duration: 6 seconds</li>
            <li>Automatically aims at enemies in line of sight</li>

    <section id="Play_Style" class="main-section">
        <header>Play Style</header>
        <p>Soldier: 76 is best played as a versatile DPS who can deal consistent damage, heal himself and teammates, and
            reposition quickly. He's effective in both mid-range engagements and flanking strategies. Use Sprint to
            control your positioning, Biotic Field for sustain, and Helix Rockets for burst damage. Tactical Visor
            should be activated when you have a clear line of sight on multiple enemies for maximum value.</p>
