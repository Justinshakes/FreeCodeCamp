        <p class="small-text quote italic">"Every day is the best day when you've got a ball to chase and a friend by your side.
            Whether it's a sunny morning or a rainy afternoon, nothing beats the thrill of a good game of fetch. The
            world is a playground, and every corner holds a new adventure, from the rustling leaves to the distant bark
            of a fellow dog. Life is full of surprises, but one thing is certain: as long as there's love, a wagging
            tail, and a little mischief, the day is complete." <span class="next-line">- Wheeler</span></p>
